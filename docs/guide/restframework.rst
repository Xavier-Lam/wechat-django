===============================
Use with Django Rest Framework
===============================


Of course, the project DO work with it! Our views inherited from drf's
`APIView <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/3-class-based-views/>`_,
and we use the drf's
`Authenication and Permissions <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/>`_
too.

If you did not install drf in your project, we mocked a basic drf module,
it will work fine with your project, you have nothing to do to your code.
